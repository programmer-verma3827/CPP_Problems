/*Operators
PrepBuddy wants you to get familiar with various Relational operators. He provides you with two numerical values 
X
 and 
Y
 and your task is to find the relation between them that is,

X
 ​is smaller than
Y
X
 ​is greater than
Y
X
 ​is equal to
Y
Input format
Two space-separated integers are provided denoted by 
X
 and 
Y
.

Output format
Print the relation between 
X
 and 
Y
.

X is smaller than Y
X is greater than Y
X is equal to Y
Constraints
1
<=
X
,
Y
<=
100

Time Limit
1
 ​secon

Example
Input
4
 
6

Output
4
 ​is smaller than
6

Sample test case explanation
Since 
4
<
6
, print 4 is smaller than 6
